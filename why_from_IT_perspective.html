		Why <i>RPF</i> should be done <i>from an IT perspective</i>

	<p>
		Let's consider the <a target="_blank"
			href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gravitational-wave-astronomers-hit-mother-lode1/">news
			about the cosmic gold mine</a> again: <a target="_blank"
			href="index.html">it looks like</a> there's a large scale theory
		(General Relativity) who needs to "borrow" some pieces of a small
		scale theory (QFT) in order to work.
	</p>

	<p>
		That would sound familiar to any developer who had to use Assembly
		code (low level language) in a C/C++ project (high level language), or
		to revert to C/C++ code from Java via <a target="_blank"
			href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javah.html">javah</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		In the IT context, that's not just familiar, it's also sound and
		meaningful, once you look at the intro picture: all code, no matter if
		higher level (Java, C++) or lower level (C, assembly) would <b><i>ALWAYS
				BOIL DOWN to a COMMON GROUND</i></b>: the <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code">binary code</a>
		which runs on the hardware, making all those transistors to flip as
		required, when required, where required.
	</p>

	<p>
		On the other side, in the physical context, there's <b><i>NO
				COMMON GROUND for GR and QFT</i></b>, at least there's none yet, check the <a
			target="_blank" href="Rovelli_recap_commented.html">recap on the
			status quo by Rovelli</a>: compare the <i>"what we know"</i> section with
		the <i>"all the rest is speculation"</i> one.
	</p>

	<p>
		Now: <b>how could it be that Nature</b> (which itself ain't split in
		small vs large scale, sorry, it's just our current knowledge to be
		split that way) <b>works fine without a common ground?</b> <br> A
		single computer won't work without some sort of <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductionism">reductionism</a>
		like the one shown in the intro picture. <br> I'm not sure about
		physicians, but ANY IT PERSON will likely kick hard on this, so I'd
		recommend not to try and test us on this subject.
	</p>

	<p>
		More in general, what's the output from activities in the physics
		field? <br>What's the <i>deriverables</i> physicians produce? <br>It's
		theories (mathematical models) and experimental data (records of
		physical interactions), so it's knowledge, it's information.
	</p>

	<p>
		So, for example, a question like "is such knowledge <i>good enough</i>
		to fit into an <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_(information_science)">ontology</a>?"
		is something quite natural for IT people to ask.
	</p>

	<p>In the same way, it's perfectly natural for IT people to go and
		refactor, or go and redesign, any working legacy mess, no matter how
		complex, like fundamental physics has become these days.</p>
