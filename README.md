# Refactoring Physics Foundations

This GitHub repo is a call for a collective effort in [refactoring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) 
the foundations for Physics: the "experimental behaviour" will stay the same, and so the restricted validity of current theories,
but we'll try to get a meaningful conceptual framework, out of this messy theorethical patchwork.

It's just a set of web pages, images and videos for talking about Physics: at least that's 
[what the web had been invented for](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web), right? 

It's about Physics, but it will from an IT perspective, so anybody on GitHub can join, 
as long as they survive either the complete [Theoretical Minimum](http://theoreticalminimum.com) by Susskind
or this shorter [Contemporary Physics Recap](http://pirsa.org/displayFlash.php?id=12040020) by Rovelli.

TODO:
 - get index.html contents revised (maybe let index.html do the index and move to "intro" page")
 - finish "why from IT perspective" and "Rovelli recap commented"
 - clarify project structure: let these html pages be the "site" of a maven proj:
     - recover and import wave applet and similar demonstration code (java)
     - port testSDL to java 3D (later)
     - align site structure to mvn:site structure (find nicer skin?)
     - align stylesheet and look and feel to mvn:sites style (find nicer skin?)


Anybody interested can open issues on the contents (correctness, clarity, etc), or help with any item in the TODOs list.
