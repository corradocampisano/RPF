# Refactoring Physics Foundations

This GitHub repo is a call for a collective effort in refactoring the foundations for Physics: 
the "practical" theories stays the same, but we'll try to get a meaningful conceptual framework, 
out of this messy theorethical patchwork.

It's about Physics, but it will from an IT perspective, anybody on GitHub can join, 
as long as they survive either the complete [Theoretical Minimum](http://theoreticalminimum.com) by Susskind
or this shorter [Contemporary Physics Recap](http://pirsa.org/displayFlash.php?id=12040020) by Rovelli.
