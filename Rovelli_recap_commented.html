	<p>
		This page recaps very shortly the <i>status quo</i> of contemporary
		physics, by commenting this <a target="_blank"
			href="http://pirsa.org/displayFlash.php?id=12040020">recap video
			lecture</a>, by Carlo Rovelli, which provides a <i>high level view</i> of
		what happened.<br> For a <i>detailed view</i>, I'd recommend the
		<a target="_blank" href="http://theoreticalminimum.com/">Theoretical
			Minimum</a> by Leonard Susskind.
	</p>


	<h4>What do we know so far?</h4>

	<p>
		That's the first part of the recap, starting at 5:30: the aim of such
		"incontrovertible" summary is to provide some arguments for LQG,
		showing the need (@6:00) for trying to quantize space, sort of final
		attempt, having run out of options.<br>Of course the recap is not
		about all Physics, but about the "what do we know about Nature at the
		elementary levels of Physics" (@6:20).
	</p>

	<p>
		As shown in the <a target="_blank" href="index.html">page about
			cosmic gold mine news</a>, our "current knowledge" is split into two main
		theories:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>(@6:30-@7:05) on small scale (h!=0) and with no gravity
			(G=0), we have <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">Quantum
				Mechanics</a> and (its relativistic extension called) <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory">Quantum
				Field Theory</a>, of which "macroscopical" <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#Limits_of_validity">Classical
				Mechanics</a> is just the "macroscopical" limit (when h goes to 0, <a
			target="_blank"
			href="http://www.servicemix.eu/_PHYSICS/2016-11-14%20-%20GUT%20est%20omnis%20projecta%20in%20doctrinae%20tres.pdf">look
				at the map</a>).
			<ul>
				<li>(@7:05-@8:00) still at small scale and with no gravity, we
					know the <a target="_blank"
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model">Standard
						Model</a>, which is actually part of QFT (<i>"Standard Model is a
						paradigm of a quantum field theory</i>")
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>(@8:00-@9:00) on large scale (h=0) and with gravity (G!=0),
			we have <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity">General
				Relativity</a>, which <i>"hadn't been taken seriously for a (long)
				while"</i>, till recently (<i>"last two decades"</i>), when new
			experiments (black holes, gravitational waves) and new technologies
			(say <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System#History">the
				GPS system</a>) made it <i>"completely mainstream physics"</i>.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		That's our "proven" knowledge (@9:10), <i>"those are the only
			things we know about the world"</i>, while <i>"all the rest is
			speculation"</i> (@9:30). Please notice <i>"all the rest"</i> means <a
			target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory">string
			theory</a>, <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry">supersymmetry</a>,
		etc, including <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity">loop
			quantum gravity</a> itself: that's it (see intro snapshot: @12:00).
	</p>

	<p>
		Of course, all the above works fine within its domains, but those <a
			target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain#Mathematics">domains</a>
		are "uglyly split" (<a href="why_from_IT_perspective.html">no
			common ground</a>) and "don't cover it all", meaning that Nature has more
		to show, than what's in those domains.
	</p>


	<h4>What's the open problems?</h4>

	<p>
		Indeed, <i>"we are not happy with the picture there"</i> (@12:15)
		because <i>"there are open problems"</i> (up to @16:35).
	</p>

		height="337">


	<p>...</p>



	<h4>Plain Old Gravitational Scattering</h4>

	<p>
		This (@16:35-@) is an example of <a
			href="why_from_IT_perspective.html">why an IT perspective</a> could
		bring value to the discussion: this section's title should remind IT
		people about the so-called <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_Java_object">POJOs</a>.
	</p>

	<img src="images/plain_good_old_gravitational_scattering_600.png" alt="open problems" width="600"
		height="338">

	<p>
		Indeed, it's not just <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science#Renaissance_and_early_modern_science">science
			history</a> that went through the <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance">rediscovery of
			classical Greek philosophy</a>, even IT history got to a point where the
		<i>"good plain old java object"</i> were <i>"a better way to
			restart from"</i>.
	</p>


	<p>TODOs:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>status quo: put additional images and comment the related
			passages (see email with shots)</li>
		<li>LQG proposal: this opens to both the historical-philosophical
			ridiculization and to the map</li>
	</ul>
