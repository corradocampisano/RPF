	<p>
		This page recaps very shortly the <i>status quo</i> of contemporary
		physics, by commenting this <a target="_blank"
			href="http://pirsa.org/displayFlash.php?id=12040020">recap video
			lecture</a>, by Carlo Rovelli, which provides a <i>high level view</i> of
		what happened.<br> For a <i>detailed view</i>, I'd recommend the
		<a target="_blank" href="http://theoreticalminimum.com/">Theoretical
			Minimum</a> by Leonard Susskind.
	</p>


	<h4>What do we know so far?</h4>

	<p>
		That's the first part of the recap, starting at 5:30: the aim of such
		<i>"incontrovertible summary"</i> is to provide some arguments for
		LQG, showing the need (@6:00) for trying to quantize space - sort of
		final attempt, having run out of options: this will be said later, @
		???, but it's actually due to "having reached max res": see @ ???.
	</p>

	<p>
		Of course the recap is not about all Physics, but about the "what do
		we know about Nature at the elementary levels of Physics" (@6:20). <br>
		So, as shown in the <a target="_blank" href="index.html">page
			about cosmic gold mine news</a>, our "current knowledge" is split into
		two main theories:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>(@6:30-@7:05) on small scale (h!=0) and with no gravity
			(G=0), we have <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">Quantum
				Mechanics</a> and (its relativistic extension called) <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory">Quantum
				Field Theory</a>, of which "macroscopical" <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_mechanics#Limits_of_validity">Classical
				Mechanics</a> is just the "macroscopical" limit (when h goes to 0, <a
			target="_blank"
			href="http://www.servicemix.eu/_PHYSICS/2016-11-14%20-%20GUT%20est%20omnis%20projecta%20in%20doctrinae%20tres.pdf">look
				at the map</a>).
			<ul>
				<li>(@7:05-@8:00) still at small scale and with no gravity, we
					know the <a target="_blank"
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model">Standard
						Model</a>, which is actually part of QFT (<i>"Standard Model is a
						paradigm of a quantum field theory</i>")
				</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>(@8:00-@9:00) on large scale (h=0) and with gravity (G!=0),
			we have <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity">General
				Relativity</a>, which <i>"hadn't been taken seriously for a (long)
				while"</i>, till recently (<i>"last two decades"</i>), when new
			experiments (black holes, gravitational waves) and new technologies
			(say <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System#History">the
				GPS system</a>) made it <i>"completely mainstream physics"</i>.
		</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		That's our "proven" knowledge (@9:10), <i>"those are the only
			things we know about the world"</i>, while <i>"all the rest is
			speculation"</i> (@9:30). Please notice <i>"all the rest"</i> means <a
			target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory">string
			theory</a>, <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry">supersymmetry</a>,
		etc, including <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loop_quantum_gravity">loop
			quantum gravity</a> itself: that's it (see intro snapshot: @12:00).
	</p>

	<p>
		Of course, all the above works fine within its domains, but those <a
			target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain#Mathematics">domains</a>
		are "uglyly split" (<a href="why_from_IT_perspective.html">no
			common ground</a>) and "don't cover it all", meaning that Nature has more
		to show, than what's in those domains.
	</p>


	<h4>What's the open problems?</h4>

	<p>
		Indeed, <i>"we are not happy with the picture there"</i> (@12:15)
		because <i>"there are open problems"</i> (up to @16:35).
	</p>

	<img src="images/open_problems_600.png" alt="open problems" width="600"
		height="337">


	<p>
		There's <i>two categories</i> of "open problems" (@12:30): from an <i><b>experimental
				point of view</b></i> (i.e. experimental data not fitting with any of the
		"valid theories") and from a <i><b>theoretical point of view</b></i>
		(i.e. a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta">"meta"</a>
		point of view):
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>experimental</strong>:
			<ul>
				<li><i><b>dark matter</b></i>: (@14:00) he mentioned QFT has
					"no particles" to describe it (which is not so bad, as QFT doesn't
					care of gravity), but forgot to say that GR has "no special tensor"
					for them (so can't describe the gravitation effects due to dark
					matter, which is quite bad for a theory of gravitation). <br>This
					brings <i>"experimental incompleteness"</i>: dark matter is "not
					covered": .</li>
				<li><i><b>neutrino mass</b></i>: (@13:55) not sure what he
					meant here, as <a target="_blank"
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutrino">neutrinos seems
						to be consistently described by QFT</a>, maybe it's just <a
					target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBxcC8zV46E">something
						quite weird</a>.</li>
				<li><i><b>dark energy</b></i>: (@13:51) that's quite
					controversial, as it is a property of empty space, described as the
					<a target="_blank"
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmological_constant">cosmological
						constant</a> in GR and as the <a target="_blank"
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_energy">vacuum
						energy</a> in QFT. <br> See Susskind's quote <a target="_blank"
					href="http://www.servicemix.eu/_PHYSICS/2016-09-30%20-%20Ver0.0.5%20-%20Natural%20Metrics%20-%20The%20natural%20way%20to%20Minkowski%20spacetime.pdf">here
						(quoted on pag 2)</a>: <i>"There is only one thing..."</i> or <a
					target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GgKGPyFL-TM">here
						(video description)</a>: <i>"Vacuum energy is represented by the
						cosmological constant, and is also known as dark energy"</i>. <br>Indeed
					he mentioned this "controversy" later @14:40.</li>
			</ul></li>
		<li><strong>theoretical</strong>: those in turn are split into
			two categories (@15:00), which have "nothing to do with one another"
			(@15:20):
			<ul>
				<li><i><b>"incomplete"-ness</b></i>: (@15:05), (@16:05) starts
					with some repetita juvant: completeness is a "different problem"
					than unification. This time (theoretically) "incompleteness" means
					"there's no quantum description for GR" (@16:15), while it was
					(experimentally) "dark matter not covered" (@14:00).<br>
					Anyway "incompleteness" also means "phenomena not completely well
					described by any currently valid theory" (@16:30): gravitational
					scattering is the example provided.</li>
				<li><i><b>("ugly and fragmented")-ness</b></i>: (@15:15),
					(@15:25): lots of physician have <a target="_blank"
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics">aesthetical
						arguments</a>, which had been pushing them to look for <a
					target="_blank"
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory">unification</a>.
					That push had to be so strong that a lot of them spent their entire
					lives doing <a target="_blank"
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory">string
						theory</a>, say Leonard Susskind and Lee Smolin, for example.</li>
			</ul></li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Plain Old Gravitational Scattering</h4>

	<p>
		This (@16:35-@19:40) is an example of <a target="_blank"
			href="why_from_IT_perspective.html">why an IT perspective</a> could
		bring value to the discussion: this section's title should remind IT
		people about the so-called <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_Java_object">POJOs</a>.
		Indeed, it's not just <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science#Renaissance_and_early_modern_science">science
			history</a> that went through the <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renaissance">rediscovery of
			classical Greek philosophy</a>, even IT history got to a point where <i>"plain
			(good) old java objects"</i> were <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_old_Java_object#Transparently_adding_services">"a
			better way to restart from"</a>.
	</p>

	<img src="images/plain_good_old_gravitational_scattering_600.png"
		alt="open problems" width="600" height="338">

	<p>
		What's the problem with "plain old gravitational scattering" (POGS)?<br>
		First, it's "two neutral particles" (@16:40) which "interact only
		gravitationally", where "neutral" means "carrying no charges"
		(electric, color, weak), so I'll add "except gravitational charge",
		just to try unify language (syntax) first. <br>Then I'd be more
		prudential in mentioning "bouncing", when it could be just (only)
		"scattering" (@16:50), but that's for later.
	</p>

	<p>
		The real problems come when trying doing predictions for POGS: given
		there's two different theories (GR and QFT), each one with its own
		"validity domain" (h=0 for GR, G=0 for QFT), you have to analyze your
		problem first, to see which of the two theories is "better" at
		predictions: (@17:15) <b><i>unfortunately, you have TWO
				THEORIES AND THREE REGIMES</i></b>:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>GR regime</strong>: (@18:15) when E (the "center of
			mass energy") &gt;&gt; Ip ("impact parameter" aka "targeting
			precision"), <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole">black holes</a> gets
			formed, so GR can be used for "working predictions"</li>
		<li><strong>QFT regime</strong>: (@18:00) when Ip &gt;&gt; E,
			it's "usual scattering" (<a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram">Feynmann's
				diagrams</a>), so QFT will do the job well</li>
		<li><strong>NML regime</strong>: (@18:20) there's <a
			target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_man%27s_land">a
				NO MAN'S LAND</a> region where E&sim;Ip (@18:35), which is also where <a
			target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CGh_physics">h=G=c=1</a>
			(@18:25).</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		In the NML "we have no idea whatsoever of what happens" (@18:40):
		"there's clearly a hole there" (@18:50), so again there's <i><b>"incomplete"-ness</b></i>,
		and the POGS clearly shows it is both theoretical (no working theory
		in NML) and experimental (dark matter would likely do gravitational
		scattering, right? and it will do that only, "right right"?).
	</p>

	<p>
		So, to summarize the <i><b>"missing pieces list"</b></i> (within the
		"theoretical incompleteness"), it's just POGS (@19:00), for the
		reasons above, and "early cosmology" (@19:30), because when c=h=G=1
		"GR doesn't make any sense anymore" (@19:20), since "it develops
		singularities" (@19:25), which is bad, as physicians don't like
		infinite quantities popping up unexpectedly. Let alone a few other
		details (@19:40) which again fall in the NML.
	</p>

	<p>
		By the way, I'd simplyfy the previous "GR failing at Planck scale"
		argument by saying it's just <a target="_blank"
			href="http://www.servicemix.eu/_PHYSICS/2016-03-07%20-%20Ver1.0.0-rc2%20-%20Monkey%20Metrics%20-%20Semantically%20Refactored%20Special%20Relativity.pdf">"our
			human/concrete implementation"</a> of the <a target="_blank"
			href="http://www.servicemix.eu/_PHYSICS/2016-09-30%20-%20Ver0.0.5%20-%20Natural%20Metrics%20-%20The%20natural%20way%20to%20Minkowski%20spacetime.pdf">"mathematical/absract
			spacetime metrics"</a> that stops working at that scale (c=h=G=1): SR and
		GR are <a target="_blank" href="">continuum mechanics</a>, which means
		<i><b>"a (mathematical) model assuming there's some discrete
				material, filling a region of space, which looks continuum at the
				scale/precision required by the model"</b></i>. <br>This shouldn't be
		hard to understand: there's no quantum version for GR ("our" metrics)
		because GR is "macroscopic by design". It's a dead end, there's no way out, as there's
		no way to (physically) implement (mathematical) spacetime metrics at Planck scale.
	</p>


	<h4>Is it Completeness AND/OR/XOR Unification?</h4>

	<p>
		Repetita juvant (@19:45): "indipendently of the Unification, there is
		a question of Completeness", ok, but what about the "combinations" he
		lists here? Is the list complete? It's two indipendent boolean
		variables, so there's four possible values (of which (0,0) is
		negligible) and <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truth_table#Truth_table_for_all_binary_logical_operators">sixteen
			possbile functions</a> to choose from. <br>He mentioned just 2
		special cases, I'm going to add 2 more:
	</p>

	<ul>
		<li>AND (@19:55): "it might be that the only way to complete is
			to go by an unification" and hence "that's what String Theorists had
			been trying to do" - and it looks like they failed.</li>
		<li>OR, on the complete side (@20:15): "a quantum version of GR
			could be possible without going through unification", and "that's the
			aim of Quantum Gravity" (@20:30) - notice this is OR: unification is
			neither required, nor denied.</li>
		<li>OR, on the unified side: that would make little sense, as it
			would have nothing to say about the "holes" in the status quo -
			notice this is OR: completness is neither required nor denied.</li>
		<li>XOR, allowing both sides (separately): you can have
			completeness (but not unification) and unification (but not
			completeness)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>
		Maybe a better definition for "completeness" (covering both
		theoretical and experimental sides) could be borrowed from the IT
		concept of <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_coverage">"code
			coverage"</a>, and maybe that would led to something like the <a
			target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del's_incompleteness_theorems">incompleteness
			theorem</a>: you can have three non-unified theories that cover all
		feasible experiments (and all theoretical regimes) XOR a unified
		theory which theoretically covers it all, providing a "common ground"
		to explain the three non-unified theories, but experimentally needs to
		limit to some <a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_principle">Goldilocks
			conditions</a>.
	</p>


	<h4>It's just "SYSTEM (metrics) FAILURE (at Planck scale)"</h4>

	<img src="images/just_system_failure_600.png" alt="open problems"
		width="600" height="338">

	<p>
		This segment starts when trying to explain <i><b>"why c=h=G=1"</b></i>
		(@20:50), and simply shows that "our metrics fails at Planck scale",
		for the same reasons GR did (see @19:25), because of the effects
		gravitation has on "our implementation of spacetime metrics".
	<hr>
	<p>TODOs:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>finish &amp; review/cleanup...</li>
		<li>LQG proposal: this opens to both the historical-philosophical
			ridiculization (Zeno's paradox: regression test fails) and to the map</li>
