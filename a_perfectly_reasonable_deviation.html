		Here's <a target="_blank"
			href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/2113797-gravity-may-have-chased-light-in-the-early-universe/">another
			weird news</a> I <a target="_blank"
			href="https://www.physicsforums.com/threads/where-the-scale-factor-a-t-appears-in-the-metric.903279/">tried
			to discuss about</a> already, so I'm recapping it here.
	</p>

	<p>
		This time I'm not commenting video lectures, or the article itself,
		but rather the whole approach to the "expanding universe": I'll be
		commenting the introduction to this subject, as available in the book
		<a target="_blank"
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_Gravity_in_a_Nutshell">Einstein
			Gravity in a Nutshell</a>, but since it will be around <i>"how they
			play with the metrics"</i>, it would be applicable to any books, video
		lecture, etc which does the same (i.e. Susskind in the theoretical
		minimum).
	</p>

	<p>
		The article itself starts like this: <i>"It's supposed to be the
			most fundamental constant in physics, but the speed of light may not
			always have been the same. This twist on a controversial idea could
			overturn our standard cosmological wisdom"</i> - could you resist such a
		temptation?
	</p>

	<p>
		Indeed, when reading Zee's book, I could not retain from commenting it
		this way: <br> <img src="images/page288_cut_800.jpg"
			alt="page 288" width="800" height="1096"> <br>and:<br>
		<img src="images/page289_cut_800.jpg" alt="page 289" width="800"
			height="868">
	</p>

	<p>
		Now, compare where "c" goes in the "flat metrics" and where "a(t)"
		goes in the "expanding metrics": clearly <b>c=1/a(t)</b>, which
		OBVIOUSLY means <b>c=c(t)</b>. <br>So, if a(t) "increases with
		time", then <b>c(t)=1/a(t)</b> "decreases with time", as the news was
		saying.
	</p>

	<p>It's REFACTORING again: the external behavior won't change, the
		internal workings will.</p>

	<p>How to get the speed of light to slow down? Try "dilute" the
		"vacuum energy" aka "cosmological constant", like if it were the
		kinetical energy of a gravitational gas: it's not a gas expanding in
		space, it's not either space itself expanding who-knows-where, it's
		just condensing into mass/energy.</p>

	<p>Just like a sealed bottle of water when you cool it down: the
		water vapor gets condensend into water (more water moleculas falling
		down into the water than ones jumping out of it), which acts on the
		"n" of pV=nRT: it's not just lower temperature bringing lower
		pressure, it's also "less n".</p>

	<p>At the end, aren't all particles just "ripples in the field(s)"?</p>

	<p>With a "slower c", in a unit of time light would run for a
		length, which will be the "current unit of space", using the
		Caesium133 definition, and it would be "smaller than the previous unit
		of space": it would look like space is expanding, like the current
		approach goes.</p>

	<p>The external behaviour is not changing... the internal workings
		(a gas getting diluted and supporting slower waves) is getting more
		meaningful (compared to nonsense like "space itself expanding")</p>
