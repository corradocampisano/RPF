	<h3>Open letter to physics community</h3>

	<p>
		After the <a
			href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/gravitational-wave-astronomers-hit-mother-lode1/">news
			about the cosmic gold mine was out</a>, I could not retain from having
		enough of this mess and have my say about it.
	</p>

	<p>
		Since <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole">black
			holes are predicted by General Relativity</a>, I had little to say about
		the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LIGO#History">previous
			detections of gravitational waves</a>, since <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_wave">gravitational
			waves too are predicted by General Relativity</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		Yes of course I'd have asked <i>"what's vibrating?"</i> and I'd have
		got very little satisfaction from a <i>"spacetime itself"</i> answer,
		but that's for later.
	</p>

	<p>
		For now let's focus on the fact that if you restrict to GR, <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neutron_star">neutron stars</a>
		shouldn't exist in the first place: how could they generate
		gravitational waves, then?
	</p>

	<p>
		Looks like GR has to "borrow" the <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle">Pauli
			exclusion principle</a> from <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics">Quantum
			Mechanics</a>, in order for the <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_matter#Neutron_degeneracy">neutron
			degeneracy</a> (a quantum phenomenon) to provide the pressure needed to
		prevent the star from collapsing under gravitation.
	</p>

	<p>
		That's not unique, as the same applies to <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_dwarf">white dwarfs</a>:
		they should not exists, if restricting to GR only: the exclusion
		principle is yet again needed to provide <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degenerate_matter#Degenerate_gases">electron
			degeneracy</a> (a quantum phenomenon) to provide the pressure needed.
	</p>

	<p>
		Not to mention that GR has little to say even about regular stars too:
		yes gravity makes the gas nebula to collapse into a pre-star, but you
		need <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics">QDC</a>
		(who knows nothing about gravity and how the pre-star formed) to
		understand how stars <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fusion">ignite</a> and
		burn their fuel.
	</p>

	<p>
		The astonishing realization hits you when you understand that Quantum
		Mechanics has nothing to do with <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_mechanics">Continuum
			Mechanics</a>, of which GR is just <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instance_(computer_science)">an
			instance</a>, the one describing our own <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation">implementation</a>
		of <a
			href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metric_tensor_(general_relativity)">spacetime
			metrics</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
		In GR, you have a metric tensor and a mass density in each point of
		spacetime, while in QM you have a complex number to represent a
		particle's state: they <b><i>"speak different mathematics"</i></b>,
		but it's not just that.
	</p>

	<p>
		GR and QM <b><i>"speak different physics"</i></b> too: gravitation is
		on one side, the other 3 forces on the other side, photons are shared,
		but mass is not: in QM it's only inertial mass, no support for
		gravitation, it's too weak, sorry.
	</p>


	<p>I have enough of this mess, and it's not just me, for example:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.cpt.univ-mrs.fr/~rovelli/">Carlo
				Rovelli</a>: he wrote similar "GR vs QM" arguments in <a
			href="https://www.ibs.it/realta-non-come-ci-appare-libro-carlo-rovelli/e/9788860306418">his
				books</a>, is proposing <a
			href="http://pirsa.org/displayFlash.php?id=12040020">LQG as a new
				way</a>.</li>
		<li><a href="http://theoreticalminimum.com/">Leonard Susskind</a>:
			he honestly admitted supersymmetry and <a
			href="http://theoreticalminimum.com/courses/topics-string-theory/2011/winter/lecture-1">string
				theory</a> failures, let alone <a
			href="http://theoreticalminimum.com/courses/special-relativity-and-classical-field-theory/2012/spring/lecture-4">when
				he mentioned SR was "continuum mechanics really"</a></li>
		<li>Lee Smolin: just read The trouble with Physics</li>
		<li>Frank Wilztcek: said what I wrote 9 months earlier about
			Einstein and the ether</li>
		<li>Richard P Feynmann: never satisfied, especially here, check
			body language, looks like he's sitting on a cactus</li>
	</ul>
